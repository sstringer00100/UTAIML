### Exploratory Data Analysis
[**Fitness Product Customer Data Exploration**](https://nbviewer.org/github/sstringer00100/UTAIML/blob/main/EDA_Project.ipynb)  
To execute preliminary data analysis by explore the dataset and comeup with some basic observations about the data. Build customer profile to help capitalize based on it. Also extract actionable insights that drives the sales of the business.

 **Skills and Tools:**
Pandas, NumPy, Visualisation techniques, EDA


### Statistical Learning
**Statistical Tests for Medical Insurance Claims**  
Statistical exploration and testing of medical insurance claims data to understand and prove hypotheses surrounding claims and medical conditions.

**Skills and Tools:**
Pandas, NumPy, Visualisation techniques, EDA, Hypothesis testing, Statistical measurements


### Linear Regression
**Used Car Pricing Model**  
Using the Cars4U dataset, need to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.

**Skills and Tools:**
EDA, Linear regression, Linear regression assumptions, business insights and suggestions


### Logistic Regression and Decision Trees
**Personal Loan Campaign Modelling**  
AllLifeBank dataset was used to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.

**Skills and Tools:**
EDA, Data Pre-processing, Logistic regression, Finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve, Decision trees, Pruning


### Ensemble Techniques  
**Travel Package Purchase Prediction**  
The "Visit with us" travel company dataset is used to analyze the customers' information and build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced package.  

**Skills and Tools:**  
EDA, Data Preprocessing, Customer Profiling, Bagging Classifiers - Bagging and Random Forest, Boosting Classifier - AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Stacking Classifier, Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV, and Business Recommendations  

### Model Tuning and Feature Engineering
**Credit Card Users Churn Prediction**
"Thera Bank" needs to come up with a classification model that will help the bank predict if a customer will leave the credit card services or not and the reason behind it.

**Skills and Tools:**  
Cross validation, up and down smapling, regularization, Pipelines and hyperparameter tuning
